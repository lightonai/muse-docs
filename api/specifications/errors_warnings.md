# ⚠️ Errors and warnings

If something goes wrong, the API will return **standard HTTP codes** to indicate a problem occurred:
- Codes in the **400** range indicate something was wrong with your request. This will usually be detailed: it may 
be mistyped a parameter, provided an incorrect value, etc.
- Codes in the **500** range indicate a problem with the Muse servers.
