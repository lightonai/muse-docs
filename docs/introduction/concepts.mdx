# 🪐 Concepts

If you are unfamiliar with the world of large language models, let's get you started! No expert knowledge required — and you can follow-up by [🔨 Building your first use case](/usecases).

## Rationale

**Language is central to our lives.** We use language to connect to our peers, to communicate expectations and promises to
business partners, and to learn about the world. Language is our preferred way to interact and describe our surroundings.

Recently, significant breakthroughs in machine learning have enabled **computers to better understand language**. This is
achieved using extremely large neural networks learning from processing millions of web pages, books, and more.
These models have wide capabilities, and **can simply be instructed in natural language to perform any task**.

Muse enables you to **unlock natural language generation & understanding**.
We abstract away all the fancy machine learning, and give you **a simple interface** to tackle any text-based task.

- Generate text according to natural language instructions for **copywriting and conversational AI**.
- Understand text and evaluate the probability of different options for **classification, automated Q&A, and customer support**.
- Build rich representations of text to directly compare samples or use in a downstream pipeline to perform **semantic search, document clustering, and more**.

We can specialize models for specific use-cases through [🤹 Skills](/introduction/skills).
