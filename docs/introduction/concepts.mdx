# 🪐 Concepts

If you are unfamiliar with the world of large language models, let's get you started! No expert knowledge required: it will just take a few minutes of your time to go through this page — and you can follow-up with one of our in-depth 📚 Guides.

## Rationale

**Language is central to our lives.** We use language to connect to our peers, to communicate expectations and promises to
business partners, and to learn about the world. Language is our preferred way to interact and describe our surroundings.

Recently, significant breakthroughs in machine learning have enabled **computers to better understand language**. This is
achieved using extremely large neural networks learning from processing millions of web pages, books, and more.
These models have wide capabilities, and **can simply be instructed in natural language to perform novel tasks**.

The Muse API enables you to **unlock natural language generation & understanding** through a simple application-oriented API.
We abstract away all the fancy machine learning, and give you **a simple interface to ✍️ [Create](/api/primitives/create),
🔬️ [Evaluate](/api/primitives/evaluate/select), 📊 [Represent](/api/primitives/represent/embed), and **⚙️ [Process](/api/primitives/process)** language** (upcoming).
We believe that all language tasks can be tackled through these simple primitives:

-   **Use ✍️ [Create](/api/primitives/create) to generate text** according to natural language instructions
    (e.g. copywriting, conversational AI, etc.).
-   **Use 🔬️ [Evaluate](/api/primitives/evaluate/select) to understand text**, and evaluate the likelihood of different options
    (e.g. classification, automated Q&A, etc.).
-   **Use 📊 [Represent](/api/primitives/represent/embed) <Alpha /> to build rich representations of text**, to directly compare samples or use in a downstream pipeline (e.g. semantic search, document clustering, etc.)

These features can be combined to **⚙️ [Process](/api/primitives/process) text, achieving complex end-results**
(e.g. document summarization, search, etc.). We expose pre-made business-ready use cases through special endpoints,
as well as through 🤹 **[Skills](/api/skills), an easy way to specialize our models to specific tasks**.
