# ðŸ¤– Models

The model is the magic behind the API. It is a large neural network with billions of parameters, calibrated by reading and learning from hundreds of billions of words sourced from web pages, books, scientific articles, and more. During this training, the model learns to model language accurately (i.e. to predict the next word of a text). Think about how, when sending text messages, you get suggestions trying to predict the next word you want to type. The variety, quality, and sheer amount of our curated training data result in universal language models, able to handle diverse tasks simply by taking in natural language instructions.

We offer ðŸ¤– Models of different capabilities in various languages. for example, if you want just want to 
play around in English, use lyra-en, for French, use lyra-fr.
