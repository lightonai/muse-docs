# ‚úçÔ∏è Prompts

The prompt is the input text you submit to the model in the ‚úçÔ∏è Create endpoint. The model will generate and return text conditioned by your prompt: if your prompt is "Fran√ßois Mitterrand was the president of", the model will most likely return "France".

The prompt will condition the model to follow given instructions or style. If your prompt is formal, it is highly likely that the model will continue in a formal way. Similarly, complex styles and structures can be imposed on the model (e.g. poems, haiku, lists). You can also give literal instructions in the prompt, such as "Write an ad for Muse:", or "This is a sentiment classifier.". Following-up with a few structured examples can also be helpful.

You can think of the prompting process as a way to program the model to achieve your desired output. The more specific and the more context you can provide, the better the results. Play around to get a feel for it, and use our examples as inspiration.
