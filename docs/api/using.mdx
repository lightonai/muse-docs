# 🤩 Using the Muse API

We offer three ways to query the Muse API:

-   Directly through **[HTTP requests](/api/specifications/requests)**, the most flexible format to implement in your application.
-   With one of our official **[binding libraries](#bindings)**, in the language of your choice.
-   Using our **[online playground](https://muse.lighton.ai)**, an ideal environment for developing new prompts.

We offer a number of **primitives** (endpoints) through which you can interact with the API. Broadly, these
are split in four categories:

-   ✍️ **[Create](/api/endpoints/create)** enables you to **generate and manipulate text according to a prompt**.
    The possibilities with ✍️ **[Create](/api/endpoints/create)** are endless: from simply assisting with copywriting, to taking in complex instructions and performing arbitrary tasks (chatbots, keywords extraction, etc.)
    This is the main gateway to Muse, and **we recommend you get started with this endpoint**.

-   🔬️ **[Evaluate](/api/endpoints/analyse)** endpoints help you incorporate **natural language understanding** in your product. Leverage 🧪 **[Analyse](/api/endpoints/analyse)** to help your machine learning pipeline unlock unique insights, or directly use 🔘 **[Select](/api/endpoints/select)** for text classification.

-   📊 **[Represent](/api/endpoints/embed)** <Alpha /> builds **computer-understandable representations of sentences, paragraphs, and documents**. Enhance your machine learning pipeline and semantic search applications with rich contextual embeddings from 🔢 **[Embed](/api/endpoints/embed)**, or directly use ⚖️ **[Compare](/api/endpoints/compare)** to find semantically-similar texts.

**Don't know where to start? Have a look at the examples on our [Playground](https://muse.lighton.ai) or the
[demo notebook](https://github.com/lightonai/lightonmuse/blob/master/examples/demo_notebook.ipynb)!**

## Bindings

We offer a number of **official bindings libraries** to use the Muse API directly with your favorite language.
