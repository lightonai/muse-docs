# ⚠️ Errors and warnings

If something goes wrong, the API will return **standard HTTP codes** to indicate a problem occurred:

-   Codes in the **400** range indicate something was wrong with your request. This will usually be detailed: it may
    be mistyped a parameter, provided an incorrect value, etc.

    ```json title="Example response to a malformed request"
    {
        "detail": "Invalid api key"
    }
    ```

    ```json title="Example response to another malformed request where the X-Model header is missing"
    {
        "detail": "Missing X-Model key"
    }
    ```

-   Codes in the **500** range indicate a problem with the Muse servers.
