# 🔑 Authentication

## API keys

Authentication to Muse is based on **API keys**. You may generate as many API keys as you need, to separate
applications or usage. You should **not** generate an API key for each one of your end users.

Muse API keys have the following format: `f89d6b69-tOWf6Ppw7LEvQryEo2FGUwf8dLpz7OxVqIQEywWigLNqb50JscU8jw0`, where
`f89d6b69` is an **8-character user identifier** (shared across all your keys), followed by **55 random characters
unique to each key**.

:::danger Keep your API key safe! 🔐
**Your API keys should stay strictly private, and should never be exposed to end-users**. You are responsible for
keeping it safe: should your API key get leaked somehow, you should immediately revoke it to avoid unwanted use.
:::

## Authenticating an API call

All API calls should be authenticated by **providing the API key to the `X-API-KEY` header**:

```bash title="Authentication header"
-H 'X-API-KEY: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

If you are using the [Muse Playground](https://muse.lighton.ai/), calls will automatically be authenticated with your default Playground API key.
