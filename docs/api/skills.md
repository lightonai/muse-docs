# 🤹 Skills

Skills enable you to **specialize models** in the Muse API to perform specific tasks, or to introduce them to
specialized domains.

Our models have been pre-trained on general data, and are good at tackling a wide variety of tasks. Skills are an
efficient way to make the models better at generating and understanding text for a specific application, style, or
format.
