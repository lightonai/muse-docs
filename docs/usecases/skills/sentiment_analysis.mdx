# ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Ÿ Sentiment Analysis Skill

**Use the `Sentiment Analysis` skill with ðŸ”˜ [Select](/api/endpoints/select) to classify the polarity of a given text.**

The `sentiment_analysis` skill is designed to classify text as negative, neutral, or positive.

It uses the ðŸ”˜ [Select](/api/endpoints/select) endpoint, which requires you to specific `candidates` that are used for classification. In order to use the skill, the `candidates` need to be: `["-", "0", "+"]`,
with

-   `-` if the expressed opinion is negative,
-   `0` if it is neutral,
-   `+` if it is positive.

In this short guide, learn how to use the `sentiment_analysis` skill with `lyra-en`. We assume here that the reader is familiar with the parameters of Select, as well as with the Python Bindings: for more information, check out the ðŸ”˜ [Select](/api/endpoints/select), and [Python Bindings](/api/bindings/python) documentation pages. We start by initializing the client with the following code.

## Examples

We start by initializing the client with

```python
from lightonmuse import Select

selector = Select("lyra-en")
```

From there, using the skill is straightforward:

```python
output = selector("The video you showed me really got me scared", ["-", "+", "0"], skill="sentiment_analysis",)
print(output[0][0]['best'])
```

returns, as expected

> `-`

while a more neutral prompt

```python
output = selector("Mary told John to check his mailbox", ["-", "+", "0"], skill="sentiment_analysis",)
print(output[0][0]['best'])
```

returns

> `0`

Good luck classifying your own text!
