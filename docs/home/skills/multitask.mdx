# 🧑‍🏫 Multitask

**Use the `Multitask` [Skill](/api/skills) to make Muse execute instructions using ✍️ [Create](/api/endpoints/create).**

The `Multitask` skill is made to execute instructions, provided in natural language. It is designed to be aligned with the user. `Multitask` can reply to trivia questions, generate poetry, music, or essays. It can reply to comprehension questions or generate the questions for a given prompt.

Note that, whenever using `Multitask`, it is important to select the appropriate [sampling](/home/concepts#sampling) mode according to the type of instructions provided. As a rule of thumb, **greedy** is more suitable for trivia questions, while **nucleus** provides better results for creative tasks.

In this guide, we explore a few examples using `lyra-en` to showcase the flexibility of the `Multitask` skill. We assume here that the reader is familiar with the use of Create, as well as with the Python Bindings: for more information, check out the ✍️ [Create](/api/endpoints/create), and [Python Bindings](/api/integrations/python) documentation pages. We assume that the client has been initialized by running

```python
from lightonmuse import Create

creator_fr = Create("lyra-en")
```

## Trivia Questions

`Multitask` can be directly prompted with questions to answer

```python
output = creator("What is the capital of Madagascar?", skill="multitask", mode="greedy")
print(output[0][0]['completions'][0]['output_text'])
```

> Antananarivo

Or with direct instructions

```python
output = creator("List three countries in Asia:", skill="multitask", mode="greedy")
print(output[0][0]['completions'][0]['output_text'])
```

> China, Japan and Korea

## Creative Tasks

`Multitask` can also be used to generate a sentence that includes a set of words:

```python
output = creator("Create a sentence with the following words: [tennis, Rome, sunset]:", skill="multitask", n_tokens=30)
print(output[0][0]['completions'][0]['output_text'])
```

returns

> sunset over the obelisk in Rome from a comfortable place of resting next to the tennis court .

It can also create poetry!

```python
output = creator("Create a sad poetry about love:", skill="multitask", n_tokens=65)
print(output[0][0]['completions'][0]['output_text'])
```

> Then I can't control myself anymore. I'm caught in a constant train of desire. My heart wishes it will never end. I feel a yearning to go back to the place I was a year ago. And I really want to see her once more. And tell her what I feel deep in my heart.

Finally, we can also use it to find missing words in a sentence.

```python
output = creator("He thought he had time to take the scenic route to the store, but the _ was closed early.. What is _?", skill="multitask", mode="greedy")
print(output[0][0]['completions'][0]['output_text'])
```

> a store

Time for you to try fun instructions to execute!
