# 👋 Introduction

**Welcome to the documentation for the 🎭 LightOn Muse API Beta!**

Uplift your product with the **natural language generation & understanding** capabilities of Muse. State-of-the-art
large language models in French, English, Italian, German, and Spanish—with more to come—are just an API call away. Our models
can help you build conversational AI, copywriting tools, text classifiers, semantic search, and more.

**🚀 What you can put in words is the only limit.**
